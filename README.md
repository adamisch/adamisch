**I'm Alex. üë©‚Äçüíª**

I'm a Senior Data Analyst on the ads team at [Doximity](doximity.com) (ex-[Underwriters Laboratories](ul.com), Data Scientist on the Artificial Intelligence Lab team). I use **Python** almost daily, particularly machine learning with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/). **R** was my first love, and is still my main squeeze for data visualization.

When I'm not a data ~~scientist~~ ~~analyst~~ person, I'm interested in carbon-based knowledge retrieval (aka a trivia nerd). I'm the volunteer president of the [Academic Competition Federation (ACF)](https://acf-quizbowl.com/about/), an organization that writes and organizes college quizobwl touraments, and a [three-time *Jeopardy!* champion](http://www.j-archive.com/showplayer.php?player_id=13013). I'm from Chicago.
