**I'm Alex. üë©‚Äçüíª**

I'm a Senior Data Analyst at [Doximity](doximity.com). I analyze ad prioritization and how tweaking our algorithms affects our outcomes, and I write failsafes that alert us when those tweaks cause issues. I use **Python** for the former and **SQL** in Snowflake for the latter.

I am ex-[Underwriters Laboratories](ul.com) as a Data Scientist on the Artificial Intelligence Lab team. I used Python daily, particularly machine learning and model building with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/). **R** was my first love and my main squeeze for data visualization.

When I'm not a data ~~scientist~~ ~~analyst~~ person, I'm interested in carbon-based knowledge retrieval (aka a trivia nerd). I'm a [three-time *Jeopardy!* champion](http://www.j-archive.com/showplayer.php?player_id=13013) and former board member of the [Academic Competition Federation (ACF)](https://acf-quizbowl.com/about/), a nonprofit organization that writes and organizes college quizobwl touraments. 

I'm from Chicago. ŒúŒ±Œ∏Œ±ŒØŒΩœâ ŒïŒªŒªŒÆŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ±. (I'm learning Greek.)
